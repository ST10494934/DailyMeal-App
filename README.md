Purpose of the App: 

Hera, a close friend of mine, often struggles with deciding what to eat on busy days. To help her, I created “DailyMeal”, an all-new an intuitive app tailored for busy people. DailyMeal is an application that allows users to input their time of day (“Morning”, “Mid-morning snack”, “Afternoon”, “Afternoon snack”, “Dinner”, “After Dinner Snack”), and depending on the time of day, it will provide users with a meal. 
With DailyMeal, deciding what to eat becomes effortless, leaving its users with one less thing to worry about.


Design Considerations:

Several factors, with careful thought and consideration, were considered in the design of DailyMeal to ensure a seamless and enjoyable user experience: 

-Simplicity and Ease of Use: Since Hera and other users may not have the time to learn complex interfaces that make it difficult to navigate through an app, DailyMeal was designed to ensure users never have to battle through this. It features a minimalistic and easy-to-understand layout with clear instructions, making meal suggestions quick and effective. 

-Colour and Aesthetics: DailyMeal was designed with the use of a calming colour pallet to put users' minds at ease (at least while using the app). It also makes the UI more appealing without overwhelming the user. 

-Interactive experience: The addition of the Battle It Out Game makes the app more fun and interactive. It allows the user to play around and have fun while using the DailyMeal app. It also provides meals that might not fit into the conventional meal types for each time of day, giving users the opportunity to try something different if they want to. 


 
Utilisation of GitHub and GitHub Actions: 

GitHub and GitHub Actions were used throughout the creation of my app, DailyMeal

-Version control was used to organise the development of DailyMeal and allowed me to easily track all my changes made to the code/program. 
-My code was hosted on GitHub which allowed me to access the code from several devices easily. 
-Due to my project being hosted on GitHub, it allowed my project to be stored in a secure location. 
-The commit feature found in GitHub allowed me to access all the previous versions of my project to aid with resolving any problems that accrued while programming. 

-During the programming of my application, I made use of GitHub Actions to automate important steps, such as automated checks, which helped catch any issues early on in the programming process and resolve them, thus improving the reliability of my app.

Testing and Debugging 

-Testing was done through the use of entering various inputs manually, and running the app on several different devices to ensure that the app works as expected. 
-DailyMeal was debugged through the debugging feature on Android Studio and with the help of GitHub debugging features.
